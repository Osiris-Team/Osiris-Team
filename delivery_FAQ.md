## Delivery / Software specific FAQ

<details>
  <summary><h4>Can the software be connected to other systems (e.g. Lexoffice, SAP, CRM)?</h4></summary>

Yes, the software is built in a **modular way**, so it can be extended later with interfaces (APIs) to third-party systems like **Lexoffice, SAP**, or **CRM tools**.

**How easy this integration is depends on the external system:**

* Some platforms (like Lexoffice) offer well-documented APIs we can use right away.
* Others (like SAP or older CRMs) may require extra coordination or development work.

We'd review together what's needed and choose the best solution for your workflow. Often, we start with core integrations and expand later if needed.

#### Integration examples:

* **Lexoffice**: *Easy to medium*. Offers a modern REST API with endpoints for invoices, customers, payments, etc. Easy to work with.
* **SAP**: *Medium to complex*. Offers APIs (e.g. OData, BAPI), but access is often restricted, and system versions vary. Usually requires planning with an SAP admin.
* **CRM systems**: *Depends on the provider*.
  * Cloud CRMs (e.g. HubSpot, Pipedrive, Salesforce): typically easy, good APIs.
  * Older/local CRMs: often lack modern APIs, integration is harder.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>How is data security and GDPR compliance handled?</h4></summary>

* All data is **transmitted securely** (TLS 1.2+).
* Regular **automated backups** are performed.
* The software is hosted in your country by a hosting provider of your choice, or in **German data centers**, fully **GDPR-compliant**, if the software needs to be in the cloud at all.

Data is stored in a database on the same system as the software.  
**Only the software can access this data - it's isolated from the outside world.**

Additionally, we use **roles and permission management**, so each user group only sees or edits what they are supposed to.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4> Is there long-term support or a maintenance contract?</h4></summary>

* A **3-month warranty** is included in the standard contract: if anything doesn't work as expected during that time, I'll fix it free of charge.
* After that, I'm happy to help with any issues or new features as **separate projects**, based on your needs.

You can view the full contract here (well-formatted version):  
üìÑ [https://github.com/Osiris-Team/Osiris-Team/blob/main/dev_contract.md](https://github.com/Osiris-Team/Osiris-Team/blob/main/dev_contract.md)  
If changes are needed, please download and edit this version of the contract as a markdown/text file.

The **source code** of the software will be shared with you, so other developers can continue working with it if needed.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>What about documentation and support?</h4></summary>

The software is built to be **self-explanatory**, with tooltips and helper texts included for more complex steps.  
In most cases, separate documentation isn't needed.

However, I usually reserve some hours for:
* Meetings
* Training videos
* Optional documentation

Personally, I recommend **screen-recorded trainings or meetings**, as they're often more helpful than written manuals.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>How flexible is the system for future changes?</h4></summary>

The system is designed to be **flexible and expandable**, so we can later add:
* New features
* User groups
* Additional modules

I work in **small, regular milestones** - for example, weekly updates - so you can test new versions early on and give feedback.  
That way, adjustments or new requests can be implemented gradually without much delay.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>Can we try out a basic version first?</h4></summary>

Yes, definitely. I follow the principle **"the most important features come first"**.  
In the **first week**, you'll already receive a basic test version with the most essential functions.

You'll be able to test everything directly on your computer and give feedback early.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>How does the typical workflow look like?</h4></summary>

- **Initial Consultation**: Free. Please provide as much detail as possible. I offer one free 15-minute online meeting.  
- **Progress Updates**: Provided every 8 hours of work.  
- **Code Access**: Code will be uploaded to a private GitHub repository, accessible only to you and me for transparent version control.  
- **Budgeting**: I work on tasks until completion or until the budget limit is reached. Please specify your preferred and maximum budgets.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>What are the advantages of hiring you as a freelancer?</h4></summary>

There are several benefits to working with a freelancer instead of hiring a full-time employee or agency:

1. **Cost Efficiency**  
   You don‚Äôt need to provide benefits, office space, hardware, or long-term commitments.

2. **Flexibility**  
   Hire for specific tasks or time periods. Scale up or down as needed without red tape.

3. **Specialized Skills**  
   Get access to expert-level knowledge and experience, tailored to your project.

4. **Reduced Overhead**  
   Remote work and independent operation mean lower operating costs for you.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>What are the common concerns with freelancers and how do you address them?</h4></summary>

1. **Limited Control**  
   Freelancers usually work independently, which can reduce oversight.  
   üëâ *Solution:* I offer guaranteed weekly hours and support specified methods, tools, or workflows on request.

2. **Lack of Loyalty**  
   Some freelancers prioritize higher-paying or long-term clients.  
   üëâ *Solution:* My rate structure ensures equal treatment across all clients with the same package, regardless of project size.

3. **Communication Challenges**  
   Time zones or language differences can make communication harder.  
   üëâ *Solution:* I speak English, German, Portuguese, Turkish, and some French, and I use your preferred communication channels depending on your rate.
