## ðŸ“„ Delivery FAQ â€“ Key Questions & Answers

### ðŸ”Œ Can the software be connected to other systems (e.g. Lexoffice, SAP, CRM)?

Yes, the software is built in a **modular way**, so it can be extended later with interfaces (APIs) to third-party systems like **Lexoffice, SAP**, or **CRM tools**.

**How easy this integration is depends on the external system:**

* Some platforms (like Lexoffice) offer well-documented APIs we can use right away.
* Others (like SAP or older CRMs) may require extra coordination or development work.

Weâ€™d review together whatâ€™s needed and choose the best solution for your workflow. Often, we start with core integrations and expand later if needed.

#### Integration examples:

* **Lexoffice**: *Easy to medium*. Offers a modern REST API with endpoints for invoices, customers, payments, etc. Easy to work with.
* **SAP**: *Medium to complex*. Offers APIs (e.g. OData, BAPI), but access is often restricted, and system versions vary. Usually requires planning with an SAP admin.
* **CRM systems**: *Depends on the provider*.

  * Cloud CRMs (e.g. HubSpot, Pipedrive, Salesforce): typically easy, good APIs.
  * Older/local CRMs: often lack modern APIs, integration is harder.

### ðŸ”’ How is data security and GDPR compliance handled?

* All data is **transmitted securely** (TLS 1.2+).
* Regular **automated backups** are performed.
* The system is hosted in **German data centers**, fully **GDPR-compliant**.

Data is stored in a database on the same server as the software.
**Only the software can access this data â€“ itâ€™s isolated from the outside world.**

Additionally, we use **roles and permission management**, so each user group only sees or edits what they are supposed to.

### ðŸ”§ Is there long-term support or a maintenance contract?

* A **3-month warranty** is included in the standard contract: if anything doesnâ€™t work as expected during that time, Iâ€™ll fix it free of charge.
* After that, Iâ€™m happy to help with any issues or new features as **separate projects**, based on your needs.

You can view the full contract here (well-formatted version):
ðŸ“„ [https://github.com/Osiris-Team/Osiris-Team/blob/main/dev\_contract.md](https://github.com/Osiris-Team/Osiris-Team/blob/main/dev_contract.md)
Iâ€™ve also attached the plain-text version in case you want to suggest changes.

The **source code** of the software will be shared with you, so other developers can continue working with it if needed.

---

### ðŸ“˜ What about documentation and support?

The software is built to be **self-explanatory**, with tooltips and helper texts included for more complex steps.
In most cases, separate documentation isnâ€™t needed.

However, Iâ€™ve reserved some hours for:

* Meetings
* Training videos
* Optional documentation

Personally, I recommend **screen-recorded trainings or meetings**, as theyâ€™re often more helpful than written manuals.

---

### ðŸ”„ How flexible is the system for future changes?

The system is designed to be **flexible and expandable**, so we can later add:

* New features
* User groups
* Additional modules

I work in **small, regular milestones** â€“ for example, weekly updates â€“ so you can test new versions early on and give feedback. 
That way, adjustments or new requests can be implemented gradually without much delay.

---

### ðŸ§ª Can we try out a basic version first?

Yes, definitely. I follow the principle **"the most important features come first"**.
In the **first week**, youâ€™ll already receive a basic test version with the most essential functions.

Youâ€™ll be able to test everything directly on your computer and give feedback early.

### ðŸ‘‡ How does the typical workflow look like?
    
- **Initial Consultation**: Free. Please provide as much detail as possible. I offer one free 15-minute online meeting.
- **Progress Updates**: Provided every 8 hours of work.
- **Code Access**: Code will be uploaded to a private GitHub repository, accessible only to you and me for transparent version control.
- **Budgeting**: I work on tasks until completion or until the budget limit is reached. Please specify your preferred and maximum budgets.

**Advantages:**
1. **Cost Efficiency**: No need to provide benefits, office space, or equipment.
2. **Flexibility**: Hire for specific tasks with the ability to adjust as needed.
3. **Specialized Skills**: Access experts from a global talent pool.
4. **Reduced Overhead**: Lower operating costs due to remote work.

**Common Concerns:**
1. **Limited Control**: Freelancers work independently, which may limit control over processes.  
    - Solution: I offer guaranteed work hours per week, with options for specified methods and processes.
  
2. **Lack of Loyalty**: Freelancers might prioritize other clients or projects.  
    - Solution: My rate structure ensures equal priority across clients.

3. **Communication Challenges**: Time zone differences and language barriers can hinder communication.  
    - Solution: I am multilingual and offer various communication channels based on your selected rate.
