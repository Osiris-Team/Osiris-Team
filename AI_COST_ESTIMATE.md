# Delivery Timeline
   - Calculate the estimated delivery time in weeks and clearly show all calculation steps in a table.
   - There are 3 packages with different available hours per week: "Basic" with 10h/week, "Pro" with 20h/week, and "Expert" with 30h/week.
   - Assume a single developer and use the discounted hours.
   - State that the "Expert" package is selected.
