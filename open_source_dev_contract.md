    - In this case, the Client is also obligated to give clear and concise feedback.

(e.g. Research or writing / committing code), is the DeveloperConsultants' to use as they see fit.
- DeveloperConsultant can multitask at their complete discretion.
- There is no fixed hours to encourage a healthy study/life/work balance.
- Time tracking can be done via a comment within each MR after the applicable lines of code
have been pushed such as the following example (using ISO-8601 and 24hr clock):
    - 2023-05-16
    - 08:00 - 10:20
    - 12:00 - 13:15
    - Which would be processed as 3h 35m via the following formula: (HR * 3) + (HR * 0.35).
