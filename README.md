### Projects
You can view a list of my most successful Open-Source projects [here](https://github.com/Osiris-Team?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=&sort=stargazers),
and below you can find some curated projects that give you a good overview of my strengths:

#### Custom ERP Web-Panel

A fully custom ERP Web-Panel with individual features requested by the client like an integrated web-based pdf-editor with presets and automatic data filling, a products database and customer information data storage, as well as multi-user collaboration capabalities and integrated chat and google synchronized calendar.

#### AutoPlug-Web and Client
AutoPlug is my largest personal and monetized project. Its goal is to simplify/automate maintenance tasks of server admins.
This is accomplished mainly by the AutoPlug-Client. Developing it taught me a lot about Java in general, Server-Client communication, the TCP protocol, REST-APIs, web-scraping, JSON,
and even made me consider very interesting alternatives like [Netty](https://netty.io/), which finally was not implemented due to the release of Virtual-Threads and the comparatively simpler Java Sockets-API. This is what it looks like when running some tasks (outdated):

</div>

AutoPlug-Web which can be accessed at [autoplug.one](https://autoplug.one/), is more of a centralized admin panel to manage servers
and collaborate with server staff easily.
It communicates with the AutoPlug-Client and is responsible for critical/sensitive operations like showing/adding/updating/removing files based on user permissions
and providing access to terminals. This requires a high level of security and trust from its users, which is given by using a backend and security focused framework
called [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/). Developing this part of the software taught me about handling the complexity of larger applications, webservers in general, SSL,
HTML/CSS/JavaScript, payment systems like PayPal/Stripe integrated via my [PayHook](https://github.com/Osiris-Team/PayHook) library, SQL databases and code generation with my [jSQL-Gen](https://github.com/Osiris-Team/jSQL-Gen) tool. The File-Manager looks like this (outdated):

</div>

#### Desku
[Desku](https://github.com/Osiris-Team/Desku) is a low-code, developer-first Java framework with UI components, for developing cross-platform desktop, web, android/ios apps in one codebase.
I like the Java language, however its GUI libraries feel outdated and something like this doesn't really exist, thus this project. Under the hood it's based on Webviews, meaning it uses HTML/CSS/JS to
display the frontend, which theoretically makes it compatible with all frontend frameworks out there. The focus here is to provide a developer-friendly, simple API and
handle the more complex things in Desku. This project expanded my knowledge of webserver internals and made me discover some annoyances of the Java language
(which you can find over at [my-jsrs](https://github.com/Osiris-Team/my-jsrs)).

#### Android Apps
I worked on multiple Open-Source Android apps like [OpenLauncher](https://github.com/Osiris-Team/openlauncher),
[Simple-Calendar](https://github.com/Osiris-Team/Simple-Calendar), 
[Notally](https://github.com/Osiris-Team/Notally),
[VinylMusicPlayer](https://github.com/Osiris-Team/VinylMusicPlayer), etc. where I fixed bugs and implemented new features for clients.
This taught me how to interact with existing code, fight the need of changing everything and focus on adding the requested changes only.
I also achieved a basic understanding of the Android API and the Kotlin language, plus these projects also made me better at debugging/navigating 
other developers code.

<summary>View general arguments for/against freelancers</summary>

1. **Cost Efficiency:** Freelancers are often more cost-effective because you don't have to provide them with benefits like health insurance, paid time off, or retirement contributions. You also don't have to pay payroll taxes for freelancers.

2. **Flexibility:** You can hire me for specific tasks and change that list whenever you want. This flexibility can be especially beneficial for businesses with fluctuating workloads.

3. **Specialized Skills:** Freelancers often bring specialized skills and expertise to the table. You can find experts in various fields without committing to long-term employment. Freelancers can work from anywhere in the world, giving you access to a broader talent pool and potentially lowering labor costs.

4. **Reduced Overhead Costs:** You don't need to provide freelancers with office space, equipment, or supplies, which can reduce your overhead costs.

**Common Negative Biases Against Freelancers:**

1. **Limited Control:** Freelancers work independently, so you have less control over their work hours, methods, and processes. This can be a disadvantage for projects that require close supervision.
    - There are minimum guaranteed work hours per week depending on your rate and you can specify the methods and processes if you want.

1. **Lack of Loyalty:** Freelancers may not be as invested in your company's success as regular employees. They might prioritize other clients or projects over yours.
    - I have a fixed hourly rate that I am satisfied with and that I think is fair. Clients with the same rate have equal priority.

1. **Communication Challenges:** Managing remote freelancers can be challenging, especially if they are in different time zones or speak different languages. Effective communication is crucial.
    - I speak multiple languages and there are multiple ways of communication depending on the selected rate.

### Typical workflow
- The initial consulting is free. Please try to be as specific and clear as possible. I will answer all your questions and explain why something can/can't be done. 1 free online meeting of 15 minutes is possible.
- You will get updates regarding the progress, after every 8 hours of work.
- The code will be uploaded to GitHub under a private repository where only you and I have access. This allows us to track all code changes.
- I will work on something until it is finished, or your budget limit is hit, thus tell me your preferred and max budgets.
