### About Me
My name is A. Ruben Kandel and since January 2023, I have been developing custom software for clients globally.
Originally I started coding even earlier in 2019 (mainly open-source), which has given me six years of hands-on experience. 

While my expertise covers a wide range of tasks, my primary focus lies in developing tailored CRM/ERP web panels with a lot of dynamic business logic and modernizing legacy systems/workflows.
By handling the entire software development process independently, I am able to provide highly cost-effective solutions tailored to your needs.
That said, I can also accommodate collaborative team-based development upon request, ensuring flexibility to meet your project requirements.

I am fluent in English, German, Portuguese, Turkish, and have basic proficiency in French.
Please explore more about my skills and projects below. Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out with any inquiries!

### Milestone + Feedback based Development
Unlike the traditional software development approach, where requirements are defined up front,
and you only see the finished product months later, I follow a more flexible, collaborative process.
We have a weekly call to review and test the software together, so you can give direct feedback as the product evolves. 
This way, youâ€™re not locked into early assumptions; instead, the software grows with your needs and I get a deeper understanding of your vision.
In fact, the projects where Iâ€™ve applied this method have consistently led to the highest client satisfaction and best results.
The details of how often and long these meetings are, is fully up to you and the complexity of your project.
