### About Me
My name is A. Ruben Kandel and since January 2023, I have been developing custom software for clients globally.
Originally I started coding even earlier in 2019 (mainly open-source), which has given me six years of hands-on experience. 

While my expertise covers a wide range of tasks, my primary focus lies in developing tailored full-stack websites.
By handling the entire software development process independently, I am able to provide highly cost-effective solutions tailored to your needs.
That said, I can also accommodate collaborative team-based development upon request, ensuring flexibility to meet your project requirements.

I am fluent in English, German, Portuguese, Turkish, and have basic proficiency in French.
Please explore more about my skills and projects below. Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out with any inquiries!
